Hey! My name is Darren and I am a self taught ReactJS Frontend Web Developer!


I started my self learning journey by completing the Harvard's CS50 course where I learned C, Python, SQL, etc., and more importantly: logic & problem solving skills which have helped me tremendously throughout my journey.
I have completed several ReactJS projects for my portfolio from scratch

Technologies I'm familiar with:
1. ReactJS
2. NextJS
3. Javascript
4. Typescript
5. Tailwind CSS
6. Bootstrap
7. REST APIs
8. HTML/CSS
